### Overview
This project is a To-Do List web application designed to streamline task management. It features a modern frontend built with **React Vite** and **TypeScript**, paired with a **Node.js Express** backend written in **JavaScript**. The backend handles RESTful APIs, CRUD operations, and database management with **MongoDB**.  

For authentication, the app integrates **Clerk**, allowing secure signup, login, logout, and user profile management. On the frontend, **Tailwind CSS** provides a clean and responsive UI design.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Vite with TypeScript for a robust, type-safe development environment.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for efficient API request handling and task management.
- **Authentication**: Clerk for secure user authentication and profile management.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern, and customizable design.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing task data.

### Service Architecture
The app follows a **client-server architecture**:
- The **frontend** communicates with the backend via **RESTful APIs**.
- The **backend** uses **MongoDB** to store task data with a schema including:
  - `userId`: Links tasks to specific users.
  - `title`: Task title.
  - `description`: Task details.
  - `status`: Pending, in-progress, or completed.
  - `createdAt`: Task creation date.
  - `completedAt`: Task completion date (if applicable).
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Hosted on **Vercel**.
  - Backend: Deployed on a separate Node.js server.
